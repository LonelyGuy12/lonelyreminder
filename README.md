# Project LonelyReminder

**LonelyReminder is an intelligent, offline-first, cross-platform application designed to instantly capture events from images and screenshots, keeping your schedule effortlessly in sync across all your devices.**

## üéØ Problem Statement

Manually entering event details from screenshots, posters, or whiteboards into a digital calendar is tedious and error-prone. This project aims to eliminate that friction by creating a seamless "scan-to-event" workflow that works reliably online and offline, and syncs perfectly between mobile and desktop clients (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS).

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **üì∏ Image-to-Event Capture:** Instantly create events by taking a photo or selecting a screenshot.
* **üß† Intelligent Text Analysis:** On-device AI automatically detects event titles, dates, times, and descriptions from text.
* **üö´ Offline-First Functionality:** Core features‚Äîscanning and parsing‚Äîwork entirely without an internet connection.
* **üîÑ Seamless Cross-Device Sync:** All events are stored locally and automatically synced with a central server when online, keeping Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS clients up-to-date.
* **üìÖ Calendar Integration:** Export captured events directly to your device's local calendar (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar).
* **üîí Secure & Private:** Your data is synced securely to your private backend, giving you full ownership.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project uses a modern and robust tech stack chosen for performance, scalability, and cross-platform capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The application is built on an **Offline-First** architecture. This ensures a smooth and reliable user experience, regardless of network connectivity.

1.  **Client App (Flutter):** The user captures an image. The on-device ML Kit engine performs OCR. A custom parsing service then analyzes this text to structure it into an event object.
2.  **Local Storage (Isar):** The structured event is immediately saved to the local Isar database on the device. The UI reads exclusively from this local database, making the app feel instantaneous.
3.  **Sync Service:** A background service in the Flutter app detects network availability.
    * **Push:** When online, it sends any new or modified local events to the backend API.
    * **Pull:** It periodically fetches the latest event data from the server to get changes made on other devices.
4.  **Backend API (Go):** The API acts as the central hub. It handles authentication, validates incoming data from the clients, and persists it in the MongoDB database.
5.  **Database (MongoDB):** The single source of truth for all synced data.
